### PoisotLab - 2020-III-13

[This guide](https://github.com/kguidonimartins/studygroup-ufg/blob/master/guia-de-referencia.md#trabalhando-com-branches) covers command line basics.

- Motivation
- Structure of git flow
*!* We won't talk about conflicts! There is good documentation about it online, and much of the learning is done by practicing. We suggest you create a repo to play with your teammates!

- git config
- git init
- git clone
- git remote add origin url

- git status
- git add
- git commit
- git log
- git push
- (github commit)
- git fetch
- git diff
- git pull

- git branch -a
- git branch name
- git checkout

- git merge

- update branch

- reverting commits and stage

- overwrite local changes


### Good practices on PRs and Issues
- make smaller and frequent PRs
- tag the related issue so it closes automatically once you solved the problem (PR approved)
- Take some time to write useful descriptions
- Be precise on commit messages (descriptive, but short)

#### Issues
- Same tips for PRs
- Use tags, milestones, projects!
- Tag people to delegate
- Tag related branches
- Tag related code
- If it's a bug, provide reproducible examples and system especifications
